                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-5">Matt K, aka DJ Slyde, is no stranger to diversity. Hailing from the melting pot of Seattle, DJ Slyde found his infatuation with music at the age of 4. His first love of 90s hip-hop and R&amp;B inspired him to take part of the revolutionary culture that helped bridged the inner city together. DJ Slyde began making cassette tape mixes of his favorite tracks in elementary school and eventually began dispersing mixtapes throughout high school to supply local parties with the hottest tracks. At the ripe age of 19, DJ Slyde moved to Japan to expand his horizons and found his calling as a DJ. A self taught DJ, DJ Slyde started off performing at small local bars. His popularity soared within a year and his parties became the premier spots for partygoers in the area.  He eventually snagged residencies at the hottest clubs in Tokyo and started to gain bookings for private events and weddings.
<br>
<br>After moving back to the states in 2017, DJ Slyde took a brief hiatus from DJing to focus on his professional life. Realizing life without music as meaningless, DJ Slyde decided to fill the void by resurrecting his passion for DJing. DJ Slyde credits the city of Philadelphia as his motivation for further pursuing his DJ craft and is going at full speed to give his audiences the party they have been looking for.&nbsp;</p>

                        I was born and raised in Philadelphia, growing up listening to smooth jazz, classic rock and hip hop. It has always been a dream of mine, since I can remember, to be involved in some form of music entertainment. I attended Archbishop Ryan High School where at age 16 I hosted my first event, DJing for Ryan’s Honor’s Society Banquet. I’ve been DJing and entertaining ever since. For the past 16 years I’ve hosted events for Temple University, Ursinus College, Cabrini College, bars, clubs, countless weddings &amp; private events. I was also in the cover band scene as a lead singer.

                        DJ Yoseph was born and raised in the Philadelphia suburbs. Ever since he was young, he has always loved curating playlists and burning CD’s of music for friends and family to play at their events and parties. He aspired to get into mixing and producing his own music, which came to fruition when he was gifted a used DJ controller at age 17 by a good friend. He spent the Summer of that year learning how to mix properly and getting proficient at the basics and that Fall, he secured a weekly DJ gig at The Plough and the Stars in Old City. From there, he never looked back. He immediately fell in love with the energy of a big crowd moving and singing in unison to the music he was playing. He soon pivoted to producing his own tracks in Ableton and Maschine. He focused primarily on making his own remixes of popular songs to play at his gigs, while also dabbling in creating music for his friends' various creative pursuits. He spent the next 12 years networking and playing music around Old City while taking almost every private gig that was offered to him. He also attended college at Temple University and then law school at Drexel University. Being able to DJ and get people dancing has been both a hobby and a source of comfort when the stresses of school or work become overwhelming. Nothing gives him a sense of calm and control like knowing he has a crowd hanging on every transition and song choice. He loves being able to spread the joy of good music to new people, and doesn’t plan on stopping any time soon.

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-5">I started out with an iPod, an aux cord, and an air of musical superiority at Baptist High basement parties over a decade ago. My roommate and I had the most popular show on Messiah College radio, and the professionalism I learned there helped me make my hobby pay for itself. Diving into the Philly bar scene after some time in England and California, I decided that meant my own turntables, then CDJs.
<br>
<br>Now I can rock a party with equipment as eclectic as the music, whether that means the vinyl my wife wishes wasn’t filling our basement, a remix I’m working on for a friend’s band, or my kids’ latest obsession (Lately it’s the Benny Benassi remix of Public Enemy’s “Bring the Noise”). There’s nothing I love more than blending old and new, popular and obscure, to find the perfect mix for any event!</p>
